#### What aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
The main purpose of this assignment was to implement a priority queue using a min heap.  All of the test cases have been passed.  Although it is unclear if the enqueue() and dequeue method are implemented in the fastest time. 

#### Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab
I did not work with anyone on this assignment. 

#### Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab
This assignment took about 6 hours to complete.

#### Any additional notes including extra efforts
This assignment was fun.  It was a good exercise to think through the enqueue and dequeue algorithms. I would like to know if I implemented it achieves the O(nlogn) time and if not what the more efficient way to complete it is.
