# Assignment 5
#### Modified Files:
Combine.cpp

#### What aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
The combine function in Combine.cpp is correctly implemented. The assignment was to implement a function that takes in a Vector of Vector elements that are varying sizes but all individual sorted.  the task then was to merge the Vectors into one sorted Vector. 

#### Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab.
I did not collaborate with anyone on the assignment.  I did look up how to implement the merge portion of the function.  

#### Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab.
I spent about 3 hours on this assignment. 

#### Any additional notes including extra efforts
I tried writing some code in Java since I am more familiar with Java to better understand how the function was working.  Here is the link to the file: https://replit.com/@DaniellePike/CombineJava2#Main.java
