# Assignment 8

#### Modified Files
Labyrinth.cpp
SplicingAndDicing.cpp

#### What aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
The purpose of this assignment is work with linked lists.  The Labyrinth code is complete.  One of the test cases does not pass, even though it seems to work.  For SplicingAndDicing, deleteNucelotide and fromDNA seem to work properly.  An attempt at toStrand and findFirst are in the code, but do not pass all the test cases. spliceFirst was not attempted yet.

#### Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab
This assignment gave me the most trouble.  I tried working out the code in a simpler example to understand how to add to the linked list and search.  I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.  I did collaborate with Andrew on the replit file. 

#### Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab
This assignment took about 6 hours to complete.

#### Any additional notes including extra efforts
I tried out writing some methods with linked lists in replit.  Here is the code: https://replit.com/@DaniellePike/SpliceDice2#main.cpp
