# Assignment 7

#### Modified Files
LinearProbingHashTable.cpp
RobinHoodHashTable.cpp

#### What aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
The main purpose of this assignment was to implement two different types of hash tables: Linear Probing and Robin Hood.  All the test cases were past except for the last Stress test for Linear Probing.  I tried to implement both hash tables efficiently, stopping early when possible.  I am not sure if they are implemented in the most efficient time or not.

#### Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab
I got a little stuck on the Linear Probing Hash Table and Andrew and Ming helped to debug.  Otherwise I did not collaborate with anyone else. I consulted the notes for help on the assignment. 

#### Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab
This assignment took about 6 hours to complete.

#### Any additional notes including extra efforts
This assignment really helped me process hash tables and how they are implemented.  Specifically how lookups can be fast.
